Challenge 5 - Hamster Hotel

HTML/CSS/Bootstrap project where we recreate a prototype "Hamster Hotel" as best as we can.

# Peer Review: Marcel Rodriguez

Website looks good. Liked the alignment of the navbar links on top when sizing down from the desktop version. The outline offset code was cool instead of the border outline. The links worked properly in the navbar. Suggested the room card buttons be centered when sizing down frmo the desktop version and also the image of the hamster under the header to be stretched to fill the entire phone screen. Brandon - Will work on centering all info plus the button on the cards on the mobile version before turning in.
